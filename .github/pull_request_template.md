A clear testing scenario helps colleagues who may not be familiar with this part of the code quickly understand and verify the changes. Include steps they can follow to see the impact in action.

You can include: 
- Simulators/Devices you used (e.g. iPhone 13, iPad Pro) 
- iOS versions tested (e.g. 16.0, 17.5) 
- Manual checks (e.g. flow tested: onboarding, permissions, error states) 
- Unit tests added or updated 
 
 Include screenshots, screen recordings, or simulator gifs for UI changes. 
 
 - Optional: Anything that needs extra attention in review? Are there TODOs, known limitations, or follow-up work?
