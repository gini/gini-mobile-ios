The Gini Capture SDK provides components for capturing, reviewing and analyzing photos of invoices and remittance slips.

By integrating this SDK into your application you can allow your users to easily take a picture of a document, review it and getting analysis results from the Gini backend.

We provide pre-defined screens that can be customized in a limited way. The screen and configuration design is based on our long-lasting experience with integration in customer apps.

On *iPhone*, the Gini Capture SDK has been designed for portrait orientation.
On *iPad* we support portrait and landscape orientations.
