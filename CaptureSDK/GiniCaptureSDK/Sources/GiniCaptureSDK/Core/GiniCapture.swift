/**
 Convenience class to interact with the Gini Capture SDK.
 
 The Gini Capture SDK provides views for capturing, reviewing and analysing documents.
 
 By integrating this library in your application you can allow your users to easily take a picture of
 a document, review it and - by implementing the necessary callbacks - upload the document for analysis to the Gini Bank API.
 
 The Gini Capture SDK can be integrated in two ways, either by using the **Screen API** or
 the **Component API**. The Screen API provides a fully pre-configured navigation controller for
 easy integration, while the Component API provides single view controllers for advanced
 integration with more freedom for customization.
 
 - important: When using the Component API we advise you to use a similar flow as suggested in the
 Screen API. Use the `CameraViewController` as an entry point with the `OnboardingViewController` presented on
 top of it. After capturing let the user review the document with the `ReviewViewController` and finally present
 the `AnalysisViewController` while the user waits for the analysis results.
