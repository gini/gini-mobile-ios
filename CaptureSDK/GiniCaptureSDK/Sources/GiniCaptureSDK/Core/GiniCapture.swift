 Convenience class to interact with the Gini Capture SDK.
 
 The Gini Capture SDK provides views for capturing, reviewing and analysing documents.
 
 By integrating this library in your application you can allow your users to easily take a picture of
 a document, review it and - by implementing the necessary callbacks - upload the document for analysis to the Gini Bank API.
 
 The Gini Capture SDK can be integrated using the **Screen API**.
 The Screen API provides a fully pre-configured navigation controller for easy integration.
