Installation
=============================

Gini Health API Library can either be installed by using Swift Package Manager or by manually dragging the required files to your project.

## Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/)  is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code.
Once you have your Swift package set up, adding `GiniHealthAPILibrary` as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your `Package.swift`

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/gini/health-api-library-ios.git", .exact("4.3.1"))
]
```

In case that you want to use the certificate pinning in the library, add `GiniHealthAPILibraryPinning`:
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/gini/health-api-library-pinning-ios.git", .exact("4.3.1"))
]
```

## Manually

If you prefer not to use a dependency management tool, you can integrate the Gini Health API Library into your project manually.
To do so drop the [GiniHealthAPILibrary](https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-ios/tree/main/HealthAPILibrary/GiniHealthAPILibrary) (classes and assets) folder into your project and add the files to your target.

For integrating [GiniHealthAPILibraryPinning](https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-ios/tree/main/HealthAPILibrary/GiniHealthAPILibraryPinning) copy the sources as well as sources for [GiniHealthAPILibrary](https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-ios/tree/main/HealthAPILibrary/GiniHealthAPILibrary) (classes and assets).

Xcode will automatically check your project for swift files and will create an autogenerated import header for you.
Use this header in an Objective-C project by adding

```Obj-C
#import "YourProjectName-Swift.h"
```

to your implementation or header files. Note that spaces in your project name result in underscores. So `Your Project` becomes `Your_Project-Swift.h`.
