Installation
=============================

Gini Health SDK can either be installed by using CocoaPods or by manually dragging the required files to your project.

## CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate the library into your Xcode project using CocoaPods specify it in your `Podfile`, as follows:

```ruby
pod "GiniHealth"
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

## Manually

If you prefer not to use a dependency management tool, you can integrate the Gini Health SDK into your project manually.
To do so drop the GiniPayBusiness (classes and assets) folder into your project and add the files to your target.

Xcode will automatically check your project for swift files and will create an autogenerated import header for you.
Use this header in an Objective-C project by adding

```Obj-C
#import "YourProjectName-Swift.h"
```

to your implementation or header files. Note that spaces in your project name result in underscores. So `Your Project` becomes `Your_Project-Swift.h`.
