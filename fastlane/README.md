# Available Actions

## iOS

### ios generate_certificates

```sh
[bundle exec] fastlane ios generate_certificates

Generate certificates and provisioning profiles for app development.

This lane creates new development certificates and provisioning profiles from scratch.

Parameters:
  distribution_type - Type of distribution: "development", "adhoc", "appstore" (default: "development")

Environment Variables:
  APP_IDENTIFIER    - Bundle identifier for the app (e.g. com.company.app)
  MATCH_GIT_URL     - Git URL with authentication token for the match certificates repository
                      Format: https://<token>@github.com/organization/repo.git


### ios refresh_profiles

```sh
[bundle exec] fastlane ios refresh_profiles
```

Refresh provisioning profiles without generating new certificates.

This lane updates existing provisioning profiles to include new devices or 
refresh expired profiles while keeping the existing certificates intact.
Use this when you need to add new devices or refresh profiles without creating new certificates.

Parameters:
  distribution_type - Type of distribution: "development", "adhoc", "appstore" (default: "development")

Environment Variables:
  APP_IDENTIFIER    - Bundle identifier for the app (e.g. com.company.app)
  MATCH_GIT_URL     - Git URL with authentication token for the match certificates repository

### ios register_new_devices

```sh
[bundle exec] fastlane ios register_new_devices
```

Register new devices from a devices file.

This lane reads device UDIDs and names from a text file and registers them
with your Apple Developer account. The devices file should contain one device
per line in the format: "UDID<tab>Device Name" or just "UDID".

Parameters:
  devices_file - Path to the devices file (default: "./devices.txt")

Example devices.txt format:
  1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678	John's iPhone
