The Gini Bank API Library provides components for uploading, reviewing and analyzing photos of invoices and remittance slips.

By integrating this library into your application you can allow your users to easily upload a picture of a document, review it and get analysis results from the Gini backend, create a payment and send it to the prefferable payment provider.
