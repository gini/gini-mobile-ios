# * <type>: the type of the commit is one of the following:
#   * feat: new or modified features including UI and public API changes.
#   * fix: bug fixes.

#     linter errors, etc.
#   * docs: documentation changes.
#   * ci: changes to build scripts or any other automation scripts or 
#     configs (e.g., jazzy config, sphinx config).
# * <project>: project that the commit makes changes to. If it makes 
#   changes to many sections, or if no section in particular is 
#   modified, leave blank without the parentheses. 
#   Examples:
#   * Commit that changes the GiniBankSDK project:
#     feat(GiniBankSDK): Add error logging interface
#   * Commit that updates the GiniHealthSDK documentation:
#     doc(GiniHealthSDK): Update extraction feedback guide
#   * Commit that changes the build script:
#     ci: Send slack message with build result
#   * Commit that changes many projects:
