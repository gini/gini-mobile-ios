The Gini Merchant SDK provides the UI and functionality needed to use the Gini Health API in your app to extract payment and health information from invoices. The payment information can be reviewed and then the invoice can be paid using any available payment provider app (e.g., banking app).

The Gini Health API provides an information extraction service for analyzing health invoices. Specifically, it extracts information such as the document sender or the payment relevant information (amount to pay, IBAN, etc.). In addition it also provides a secure channel for sharing payment related information between clients.

## Requirements

- iOS 13.0+
- Xcode 15.3+

**Note:**
In order to have better analysis results it is highly recommended to enable only devices with 8MP camera and flash. These devices would be:

* iPhones with iOS 13 or higher.
* iPad Pro devices (iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 4 have 8MP camera but no flash).
