## Gini Pay Deep Link For Your App

In order for banking apps to be able to return the user to your app after the payment has been resolved you need register a scheme for your app to respond to a deep link scheme known by the Gini Bank API.

>  **Info:**
You should already have a scheme and host from us. Please contact us in case you don't have them.

The following is an example for the deep link `gini-pay://payment-requester`:

## Testing

An example banking app is available in the [Gini Mobile Monorepo iOS](https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-ios/blob/main/BankSDK/GiniBankSDKExample/GiniBankSDKExampleBank) repository.

In order to test using our example banking app you need to use development client credentials. This will make sure
the Gini Merchant SDK uses a test payment provider which will open our example banking app. To inject your API credentials into the Bank example app you need to fill in your credentials in [Credentials.plist](https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-ios/blob/main/BankSDK/GiniBankSDKExample/GiniBankSDKExampleBank/Credentials.plist).

### End to end testing

The app scheme in our banking example app: `ginipay-bank://`. Please, specify this scheme `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` in your app in `Info.plist` file.

After you've set the client credentials in the example banking app and installed it on your device you can run your app.

#### Payment component

After following the integration steps above you'll arrive at the `Orders list screen`. Then, you can navigate to `Order detail screen`. Tapping on `Pay` will show you the `Payment Component`.
The following screenshot shows an order detail screen with the `PaymentComponent` shown in a bottom sheet.

#### Bank Selection Bottom sheet 

By clicking the picker you should see the `BankSelectionBottomSheet` with the list of available banking apps (including `Gini-Test-Payment-Provider` and other testing and production apps).

#### More information and FAQ

By clicking either the more information or the info icon on the `Payment Component` view you should see the `Payment feature Info screen` with information about the payment feature and an FAQ section.

</br>

#### Payment Review

By clicking the `Continue to overview` button on a `Payment Component` view you should see the `Payment Review Bottom Sheet`, which shows the the payment information. It also allows editing the payment amount information. The `To the banking app` button should have the icon and colors of the banking app, which was selected in the payment component view.

Check that the details are shown and then press the `To the banking app` button:

#### Execute payment

When clicking the `To the banking app` button on the payment review you should be redirected to the example banking app where the payment information will be fetched from Gini (including any changes you made on the payment review). Press the "Pay" button to execute a test payment which will mark the payment as paid in the [Gini Merchant API](https://merchant-api.gini.net/documentation/#gini-health-api-documentation).
You should be redirected to the example banking app where the final payment details are shown:

</br>

After you press the `Pay` button the Gini Bank SDK resolves the payment and allows you to return to your app:

</br>

#### Return to your app

After the test payment has been executed, the example banking app should show a "Return back" button which should take you back to your app.

For handling incoming url in your app after redirecting back from the banking app you need to implement to handle the incoming url:
The following is an example for the url `gini-pay://payment-requester`:

```swift
    func application(_ app: UIApplication,
                     open url: URL,
                     options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey: Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
        if url.host == "payment-requester" {
            // hadle incoming url from the banking app
        }
        return true
    }
```

With these steps completed you have verified that your app, the Gini Health API, the Gini Merchant SDK and the Gini
Bank SDK work together correctly.

### Testing in production

The steps are the same but instead of the development client credentials you will need to use production client
credentials. This will make sure the Gini Merchant SDK receives real payment providers which open real banking apps.

You will also need to install a banking app which uses the Gini Bank SDK. Please contact us in case you don't know
which banking app(s) to install.

Lastly make sure that for production you register the scheme we provided you for deep linking and you are not using 
`gini-pay://payment-requester`.
