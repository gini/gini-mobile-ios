The Gini Merchant SDK provides components for uploading, reviewing and analyzing photos of invoices and remittance slips.

By integrating this SDK into your application you can allow your users to easily upload a picture of a document, review it and get analysis results from the Gini backend, create a payment and send it to the prefferable payment provider.

## Documentation

Further documentation with installation, integration or customization guides can be found in our [website](https://developer.gini.net/gini-mobile-ios/GiniMerchantSDK/index.html).

## Example apps

We are providing example app for Swift. This app demonstrates how to integrate the Gini Merchant SDK with the [Gini Capture SDK](https://gini.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ICSV/overview).

An example banking app is available in the [Gini Mobile iOS Monorepo](https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-ios/tree/main/BankSDK/GiniBankSDKExample) repository.
To check the redirection to the Banking app please run Bank example before the Merchant example. You can use the same Gini Merchant API client credentials in the example banking app as in your app, if not otherwise specified.
To inject your API credentials into the Merchant and Bank example apps you need to fill in your credentials in [Credentials.plist](https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-ios/blob/main/BankSDK/GiniBankSDKExample/GiniBankSDKExampleBank/Credentials.plist) and [Credentials.plist](https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-ios/blob/main/MerchantSDK/GiniMerchantSDKExample/GiniMerchantSDKExample/Credentials.plist), respectively.

## Requirements

- iOS 13+
- Xcode 15+

**Note:**
In order to have better analysis results it is highly recommended to enable only devices with 8MP camera and flash. These devices would be:

* iPhones with iOS 13 or higher.
* iPad Pro devices (iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 4 have 8MP camera but no flash).
