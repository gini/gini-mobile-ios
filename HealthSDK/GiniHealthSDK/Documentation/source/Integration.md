Integration
=============================

The Gini Health SDK for iOS provides all the UI and functionality needed to use the Gini Health API in your app to extract payment and health information from invoices and from digital payment orders. The payment information can be reviewed and then the invoice/orders can be paid using any available payment provider app (e.g., banking app).

The Gini Health API provides an information extraction service for analyzing health invoices. Specifically, it extracts information such as the document sender or the payment relevant information (amount to pay, IBAN, etc.). In addition it also provides a secure channel for sharing payment related information between clients. 

> ⚠️  **Important:**

For supporting each payment provider you need to specify `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` in your `Info.plist` file. App schemes for specification will be provided by Gini.


## GiniHealthAPI initialization (if you use transparent proxy with your own authentication)

If you want to use a transparent proxy with your own authentication you can specify your own domain and add `AlternativeTokenSource` protocol implementation:

```swift
 let giniApiLib =  GiniHealthAPI.Builder(customApiDomain: "api.custom.net",
                                 alternativeTokenSource: MyAlternativeTokenSource)
                                 .build()
```
The token your provide will be added as a bearer token to all api.custom.net requests.

> ⚠️  **Important:**

When you implement `AlternativeTokenSource` protocol make sure that you call the completion in one specific thread

```swift
private class MyAlternativeTokenSource: AlternativeTokenSource {
    func fetchToken(completion: @escaping (Result<Token, GiniError>) -> Void) {
        // fetch token from any thread
        // then call the completion in one specific thread
        completion(.success(Token()))
    }
}
```
## GiniHealth initialization

### Certificate pinning (optional)

If you want to use _Certificate pinning_, provide metadata for the upload process, you can pass your public key pinning configuration as follows:
```swift
    private lazy var healthSDK = GiniHealth(id: clientID, secret: clientPassword, domain: clientDomain, pinningConfig: ["PinnedDomains" : ["PublicKeyHashes"]])
```

> ⚠️  **Important:**

You should have received Gini Health API client credentials from us. Please get in touch with us in case you don't have them.

You can easily initialize `GiniHealth` with the client credentials:

```swift
 let healthSDK = GiniHealth(id: clientID, secret: clientPassword, domain: clientDomain)
```
Or initialize it with previously created `GiniHealthAPI`:

```swift
 let healthSDK = GiniHealth(with: giniApiLib)
```

## Handling documents

### Document upload
 
For the document upload if you plan to do it with `GiniHealth`. First you need get document service and create partial document.

```swift
let documentService = healthSDK.documentService()
documentService.createDocument(fileName:"ginipay-partial",
                               docType: nil,
                               type: .partial(documentData),
                               metadata: nil)
```
The method above returns the completion block with partial `Document` in success case.

After receiving the partial document in completion you can get actual composite document:

```swift
let partialDocs = [PartialDocumentInfo(document: createdDocument.links.document)]
self.healthSDK.documentService
            .createDocument(fileName: "ginipay-composite",
                            docType: nil,
                            type: .composite(CompositeDocumentInfo(partialDocuments: partialDocs)),
                            metadata: nil)

```

### Check which documents/invoices are payable

We provide 2 ways of doing this.
1. GiniHealth provides a variable for checking if the document is payable or not. You can look for `payment_state` of the document/invoice. The document/invoice is payable if `payment_state` is `Payable` 

2. GiniHealth provides a method for checking if the document is payable or not.

```swift
healthSDK.checkIfDocumentIsPayable(docId: String,
                                   completion: @escaping (Result<Bool, GiniHealthError>) -> Void)
```

The method returns success and `true` value if `payment_state` was extracted.

> - We recommend using a `DispatchGroup` for these requests, waiting till all of them are ready, and then, reloading the list.

```swift
for giniDocument in dataDocuments {
   dispatchGroup.enter()
   self.healthSDK.checkIfDocumentIsPayable(docId: createdDocument.id, completion: { [weak self] result in
       switch result {
       // ...
       }
       self?.dispatchGroup.leave()
   })
}
dispatchGroup.notify(queue: .main) {
    // Reload List
}
```

### Check if the document contains multiple invoices

GiniHealth provides a method to check whether a document contains multiple invoices:

```swift
healthSDK.checkIfDocumentContainsMultipleInvoices(docId: String, completion: @escaping (Result<Bool, GiniHealthError>) -> Void)
```

The method returns `true` in the success case if the `contains_multiple_docs` field was extracted and its value is `true`.

> - Recommendation: Use this check in a specific order. First, call the `checkIfDocumentIsPayable` method, and then call `checkIfDocumentContainsMultipleInvoices` method.

### Delete a batch of documents

GiniHealth provides a method to delete multiple documents at once:

```swift
healthSDK.deleteDocuments(documentIds: [String], completion: @escaping (Result<String, GiniError>) -> Void)
```

This method enables clients to delete multiple documents simultaneously by passing an array of document IDs. Upon success, it returns an array of successfully deleted documents. In case of an error, a specific error message is provided.

## Subscribing to GiniHealthDelegate

Conforming to `GiniHealthDelegate` protocol will allow you:
- Configure an option for implementing a custom error handling or keep an internal one.
- Getting a payment requestId which you will need for checking the payment status.
- Listening to the dismissal of the Gini Health SDK.

Please see the example of implementation:

```swift
extension YourCoordinator: GiniHealthDelegate {
    func shouldHandleErrorInternally(error: GiniHealthError) -> Bool {
        return true
    }
    
    func didCreatePaymentRequest(paymentRequestId: String) {
        GiniUtilites.Log("Created payment request with id \(paymentRequestId)", event: .success)
    }
    
    func didDismissHealthSDK() {
        GiniUtilites.Log("GiniHealthSDK was dismissed", event: .info)
    }
}

healthSDK.delegate = self
```

## Starting the Payment flow

We provide a custom payment flow for the users to pay the invoice/document/digital payment.
Please follow the steps below for the payment component integration.

### 1. Setup `GiniHealthConfiguration`.

> ⚠️  **Important:**
If you need to handle a flow with a document/invoice use a code snippet below:

```swift
    private let giniHealthConfiguration: GiniHealthConfiguration = {
        let config = GiniHealthConfiguration()
        config.useInvoiceWithoutDocument = false
        return config
    }()

    healthSDK.setConfiguration(giniHealthConfiguration)
```

### 2. Start the Payment Flow

After configuring the healthSDK, you should call can start a payment flow:

If you have a document/invoice:

```swift
healthSDK.startPaymentFlow(documentId: documentId,
                           paymentInfo: nil,
                           navigationController: navigationController,
                           trackingDelegate: self)
Initiates the payment flow for a specified document and payment information.

         - Parameters:
           - documentId: An optional identifier for the document associated with the payment flow when you use a payment with document/invoice.
           - paymentInfo: An optional `PaymentInfo` object containing the payment details when you have a payment without a document or previously fetched extraction.
           - navigationController: The `UINavigationController` used to present subsequent view controllers in the payment flow.
           - trackingDelegate: The `GiniHealthTrackingDelegate` provides event information that happens on PaymentReviewScreen.
```

If you don't have any document/invoice you need to pass `GiniHealthSDK.PaymentInfo` into the method below:

```swift

let paymentInfo = PaymentInfo(recipient: recipient,
                              iban: iban,
                              bic: "",
                              amount: amountToPay,
                              purpose: purpose,
                              paymentUniversalLink: "",
                              paymentProviderId: "")

health.startPaymentFlow(documentId: nil,
                        paymentInfo: paymentInfo,
                        navigationController: navigationController,
                        trackingDelegate: self)
```

### Optional (Recommended start payment entry button):

We also provide trust marker information for creating a subview that displays the available banks and their respective numbers. See Figma [here](https://www.figma.com/design/tHVSZ2BOlnx1mrfFrWeo87/iOS-Gini-Health-SDK-5.6-UI-Customization--WCAG-2.1-?node-id=16914-16138&t=vrAVy8gvjhDLHRca-1)
For that please call next method:

```swift
    let logos = health.fetchBankLogos().logos // for the first two payment providers available
    let additionalBankNumberToShow = health.fetchBankLogos().additionalBankCount // for the number of additional payment providers available
```

## Delete a payment request

GiniHealth provides a method to delete a single payment request:

```swift
healthSDK.deletePaymentRequest(id: String, completion: @escaping (Result<String, GiniError>) -> Void)
```

This method enables clients to delete single payment request by passing the payment request ID. Upon success, it returns the ID of successfully deleted payment request. In case of an error, a specific error message is provided.

## Getting a payment

GiniHealth provides a method to retrieve a payment of an specified payment request:

```swift
healthSDK.getPayment(id: String, completion: @escaping (Result<Payment, GiniError>) -> Void)
```

This method enables clients to retrieve the `payment` of an specified request by passing the payment request ID. Upon success, it returns the `payment` associated with the given payment request id. In case of an error, a specific error message is provided.
