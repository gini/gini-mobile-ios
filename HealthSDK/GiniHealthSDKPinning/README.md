The Gini Health SDK Pinning provides components for uploading, reviewing and analyzing photos of invoices and remittance slips and supports certificate pinning.

By integrating this SDK into your application you can allow your users to easily upload a picture of a document, review it and get analysis results from the Gini backend, create a payment and send it to the prefferable payment provider.

## Documentation

Further documentation with installation, integration or customization guides can be found in our [`website`](https://developer.gini.net/gini-mobile-ios/GiniHealthSDK/index.html).

## Example apps

We are providing example app for Swift. This app demonstrates how to integrate the Gini Health SDK with the Component API of Gini Capture library.
Please, find more details [`here`](https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-ios/tree/main/HealthSDK/GiniHealthSDK#example-apps)

## Requirements

- iOS 12+
- Xcode 12+

**Note:**
In order to have better analysis results it is highly recommended to enable only devices with 8MP camera and flash. These devices would be:

* iPhones with iOS 12 or higher.
* iPad Pro devices (iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 4 have 8MP camera but no flash).
